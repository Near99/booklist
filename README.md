# Library project from The Odin Project

It's a booklist small app

I tired to use oop in this exercise and learned a lot from it.

The code is cleaner than the first version I did, but still messy.

The basic features are just fine. Add book to the list, remove books, and change read status.

There's no going back after read status button is clicked, I left it that way cause I don't usualy finish up reading a whole book.

All a tags in the header are just for styling purpose. Maybe will add some features to it someday.

There are some serious issues I haven't fixed yet such as there's no uid for each book, have to use book title to remove element from array. 

All book.read boolean value will be set to string after page reload, didn't handle data converting issue.

Add-book button won't disappear immediately when the submit form popup.

The position of form-close button is wired I know but I am so tired of styling the page..

Website design is really the pain in the ass I have to say I don't enjoy it very much.

Read status button is not user friendly, again this is a design and styling problem.. 

And so on..

Think I'll just stick to backend coding..
